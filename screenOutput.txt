 North Carolina, Chapel Hill, University of and Washington, University of have equal ranking points
 Resolve the tie and re-order if necessary according to Head-to-Head results


 Note Logic is flaky here and may not be satisfactory if more than 2 adjacent teams are involved
 So must check by hand when see results!!

 If necessary, interchange rows in output!!
 No head-to-head match to resolve tie!!
 Logic yet to be written to resolve this!

 Final Calculated ELO Rankings: 
Wins: # of wins against other teams being considered for rankings
Losses: # of losses against other teams being considered for rankings
Bestwin(1-->3): ranking positions of the 3 best wins against other teams being considered for rankings
